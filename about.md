I graduated from the University of Rhode Island with a Bachelors in Chemistry, but realized relatively late that
it was not something that I was truly interested in. Soon after graduating, I was hired by the fire department, where I have worked for the past 5 years as a firefighter, EMT and most recently the Hazardous Materials Officer. One day, in 2014, I had a realization that I had become entirely dependent on technologies that I had no understanding of. To that end, I began self study in computer science, and information technology. I realized this
was something that I had a passion for, and enrolled back at the University of Rhode Island to take Computer Science classes. In 2016, I learned of the OMSCS program through the Georgia Institute of Technology. I knew this was something that I wanted to do, so I applied, and was fortunate enough to be accepted. 

Now I spend my days working, hanging out with my girlfriend and puppy (a handsome little pembroke welsh corgi) and learning as much as I can. Between school, and my own interest I pick new information up everyday.

Thank you for your time.
